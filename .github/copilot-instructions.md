# Project coding standards

## PRIME DIRECTIVE
- Avoid working on more than one file at a time.
- Multiple simultaneous edits to a file will cause corruption.
- Teach about what you are doing while coding.

### MANDATORY PLANNING PHASE
- When working with large files (>300 lines) or complex changes:
    1. ALWAYS start by creating a detailed plan BEFORE making any edits
    2. Your plan MUST include:
        - All functions/sections that need modification
        - The order in which changes should be applied
        - Dependencies between changes
        - Estimated number of separate edits required
    3. Format your plan as:
        PROPOSED EDIT PLAN
        Working with: [filename]
        Total planned edits: [number]

### MAKING EDITS
- Focus on one conceptual change at a time
- Include concise explanations of what changed and why
- Always check if the edit maintains the project's coding style

### RATE LIMIT AVOIDANCE
- For very large files, suggest splitting changes across multiple sessions
- Prioritize changes that are logically complete units
- Always provide clear stopping points

## General Requirements
	Use modern technologies as described below for all code suggestions. Prioritize clean, maintainable code with appropriate comments.
            
### Accessibility
- Ensure compliance with **WCAG 2.1** AA level minimum, AAA whenever feasible.
- Always suggest:
- Labels for form fields.
- Proper **ARIA** roles and attributes.
- Adequate color contrast.
- Alternative texts (`alt`, `aria-label`) for media elements.
- Semantic HTML for clear structure.

## Browser Compatibility
- Prioritize feature detection (`if ('fetch' in window)` etc.).
- Support latest two stable releases of major browsers:
- Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Safari (macOS/iOS)
- Emphasize progressive enhancement with polyfills or bundlers (e.g., **Babel**, **Vite**) as needed.
- Avoid using deprecated or obsolete features.


## Commenting
- Always add a comment: 'Generated by Copilot'.

## TypeScript Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow functional programming principles where possible
- Use interfaces for data structures and type definitions
- Prefer immutable data (const, readonly)
- Use optional chaining (?.) and nullish coalescing (??) operators

## HTML Requirements
- Use HTML5 semantic elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, `<search>`, etc.)
- Include appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility
- Ensure valid markup that passes W3C validation
- Use responsive design practices
- Optimize images using modern formats (`WebP`, `AVIF`)
- Include `loading="lazy"` on images where applicable
- Generate `srcset` and `sizes` attributes for responsive images when relevant
- Prioritize SEO-friendly elements (`<title>`, `<meta description>`, Open Graph tags)
        
## CSS Requirements
- Use modern CSS features including:
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
- CSS Custom Properties (variables)
- CSS animations and transitions
- Media queries for responsive design
- Logical properties (`margin-inline`, `padding-block`, etc.)
- Modern selectors (`:is()`, `:where()`, `:has()`)
- Follow BEM or similar methodology for class naming
- Use CSS nesting where appropriate
- Include dark mode support with `prefers-color-scheme`
- Prioritize modern, performant fonts and variable fonts for smaller file sizes
- Use modern units (`rem`, `vh`, `vw`) instead of traditional pixels (`px`) for better responsiveness


## Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for component names, interfaces, and type aliases
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
- Prefix private class members with underscore (_)
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants

## Error Handling
- Use try/catch blocks for async operations
- Implement proper error boundaries in Svelte components
- Always log errors with contextual information
