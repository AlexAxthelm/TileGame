# TileGame
A deterministic, strategy-driven tile matching puzzle game with combo chaining, powerups, and future-ready multiplayer support.

**Note:** This project is an experiment in using LLM assistants in application development.

A human has described the major features to an LLM (ChatGPT-4o), and through conversational prompts, arrived at the Product Backlog, and issues in this repo.

## Concept:

Haevily inspired by [Exponentile](https://www.bellika.dk/exponentile), this is fundamentally a match-3 game.
